# Hangman

The aim of this project was to create a fun and interactive command-line hangman game. 

The user can select the difficulty level of the game, which is either easy, medium or hard. Once this is selected, the Google Sheets API retrieves a random word from the chosen difficulty words list in the Google spreadsheet. The chosen word is replaced with dashes to hide the word from the user. The user is then asked to input a letter, if the user guesses correctly, the dash is replaced with the letter. If they guess incorrectly, the user will lose a life. The user wins the game if they can guess the word before they run out of lives, if they cant they will lose. The user has a final option to play again or not.
